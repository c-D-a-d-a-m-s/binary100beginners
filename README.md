This project is an effort to create a tutorial for the
mathematically-disinclined on the basics of binary. The tutorial assumes that
the biggest obstacle many face when trying to understand binary is an inability
to dissociate the decimal representation of a number from the idea of the
number itself. As such, the tutorial avoids making any reference to
the decimal representation of numbers until the binary number system has been
explained.
